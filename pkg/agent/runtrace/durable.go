// Usage is what a run consumed, as counted by whoever ran it.

// A durable agent run needs this because its Recorder does not survive: the run
// finishes on whichever instance committed its terminal transition, which is not
// necessarily the one that opened the log. The runtime meters usage on the
// Process itself, so the caller reads it from there and hands it over.

// FinishRun ends a run record from a process that does not hold its Recorder.

// It is the durable counterpart of Recorder.Finish: it reloads the RUNNING log
// the run opened, folds in the supplied usage, and transitions it — execErr nil
// → SUCCESS, non-nil → FAILED. Reloading rather than carrying the Recorder is
// the whole point: an agent run spans many transitions and may end on another
// instance entirely.
//
// Every persistence failure is non-fatal (errutil.Handle), for the same reason
// Recorder.Finish treats them that way: the run record is observability, and
// losing it must never fail the turn that produced it.
