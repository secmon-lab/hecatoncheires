// This is not a formality. A context with no auth token is read by the usecase
// layer as a system context and BYPASSES private-case access control entirely
// (see tokenActor in pkg/usecase/case_access.go). So for an agent working on a
// person's request, a missing actor is not "reduced access" — it is full
// access, and a private case becomes readable by someone who is not in its
// channel.
//
// Every human-triggered agent is listed. The pre-agentkit hosts injected the
// token only in the workspace agent, so the mention agents did read private
// cases for a non-member; that is the behaviour being corrected, not preserved.
//
// The unattended agents are NOT listed. A Job and the assist batch run on a
// schedule with nobody behind them, so there is no actor to name and their
// system-context access is the intended one. A sub-agent inherits its parent's
// metadata, so it carries whatever actor the parent was given.
// AgentCaseThreadCreate is the scoped exception. A thread-mode case may be
// raised by an integration bot's intake post that names no human, so demanding an
// actor there would refuse a legitimate creation — the same relaxation
// Case.ValidateNew already makes for the reporter. It is safe because a create
// turn's palette (KnownToolSetIDsNoCore) carries no case-reading tool at all:
// there is no private case for a missing actor to widen access to.
